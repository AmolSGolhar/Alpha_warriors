Developing a machine learning-based fake news prediction project aimed at identifying and flagging misinformation within online content





Fake News Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict and identify fake news articles and misinformation within online content. Leveraging natural language processing techniques and a curated dataset, the model classifies articles as either real or fake, providing a tool for users to discern reliable information sources.

Features
Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for text classification.
Preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, vectorization, and feature engineering.
Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Potential integration with web browsers or social media platforms for real-time detection.
Dataset
The project utilizes a curated dataset of labeled articles, comprising both genuine and fake news examples, to train and test the machine learning model. The dataset is available in the 'data' directory.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Random forest
Adaboost 
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the preprocessing script to prepare the dataset.
Train the machine learning model using the provided scripts.
Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
Use the trained model for prediction or integrate it into other applications as needed.
